            <p>Schooldays are the best day of our lives, but today, life can be hard for the majority of teenagers. This
                means that most teenagers are always worried about their homework, exam and marks. They get a lot of
                pressure from their teachers and parents. Their teachers ask them to work harder and give them a lot of
                homework. Ambitious parents want them to do well in the exam. Some parents also want their children to
                learn foreign languages or take a computer course. As a result, many teenagers have less time for
                leisure activities. In fact, they need more time to relax and do what they like to do.</p>

                activities like cooking or painting gave them a complete break. More importantly, while they are doing
                what they like,they can forget about their problems. <em>Consequently, they feel relaxed and

                have cooked a meal or painted a picture, they feel proud and confident. They will then realize that <a
